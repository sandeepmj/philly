# Pivot Tables

Pivot tables allow you to sort, filter and rearrange a data set easily, tabulating totals and subtotals.

There are some major requirements, however.

Ideally, there are NO blank cells in your data list. If there are, report to fill out the list so you leave no blanks.

For this tutorial and exercise, we'll use gun deaths data from 2013-2016.

## Prepare data before creating pivot table (see previous tutorials)

1. Freeze panes so you can read the headers.

2. Filter only for Pennsylvania.

3. Copy and paste the resulting filter to a new worksheet (not workbook).

The result should look like this:

## Select cities and counties to appear in rows

If it appears in values, just click and move.

## Grouping

In this example, I have created a PivotTable that has all the incident dates. The problem is that having it show totals by random dates is not too illuminating.

Here it would be better to see totals by years.

## Grouped by years

The resulting PivotTable is more useful.
