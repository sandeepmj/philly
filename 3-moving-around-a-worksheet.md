# Moving Around a Worksheet (spreadsheet)

Data you import can quickly become unwieldy. Here are some tips to make it easier to move around and to more clearly see the data you have. 

1. Select All rows and columns

2. Expand collapsed columns

3. Freeze headers

4. Select entire column

5. Select entire row

6. Move to the end of column (or break in a column)

## 1. Select ALL rows and columns

## 2. Expand collapsed columns

When you first open a worksheet, you might notice that the columns are collapsed. It is difficult to see header titles. Look at column P below. It is too narrow to even display the numbers, and just showing a string of ###.

## 3. Freeze headers

Once you scroll down the column, you can no longer see the headers. It becomes harder to absorb what the information is.

## 4. Select entire column

Step. 1 To select an entire column, click the box above the header in that column. In the example below, the entire B column is selected.

## 6. Move to the end of column (or to an empty cell in a column)

Sometimes you want to move quickly to the end of a column. First click on anywhere in a column and then click **Control-down arrow (on a PC)** and Command-down arrow (on a Mac) to move to the end .

Note that if there's an empty cell in that column, your cursor will land there. Repeat to move to the end.
