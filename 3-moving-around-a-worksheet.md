# Moving Around a Worksheet (spreadsheet)

Data you import can quickly become unwieldy. Here are some tips to make it easier to move around and to more clearly see the data you have. 

## Select ALL rows and columns

## Expand collapsed columns

When you first open a worksheet, you might notice that the columns are collapsed. It is difficult to see header titles. Look at column P below. It is too narrow to even display the numbers, and just showing a string of ###.

## Freeze headers

Once you scroll down the column, you can no longer see the headers. It becomes harder to absorb what the information is.
