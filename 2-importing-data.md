# Importing data

Although you can double click on a CSV file and hope it opens properly in Excel, I prefer to import it to avoid conflicts and errors.

## Step 1. After creating a new workbook, click on File --> Import

A dialog box opens, asking you the file type. Select CSV, navigate to the file on your computer and import it.

## Step 2. Patience

Depending on the size of the CSV file, it can take anywhere from seconds to several dozen minutes for the data to appear in the worksheet.
