# Filtering

**Filtering** narrows the data you can see to only the categories, dates, names, etc. that you choose. 

**Sorting** sequences your data by a particular order, such as by date, name, category, or by number.  You can [follow the tutorial here](https://github.com/sandeepmj/philly/blob/master/5-sorting.md).

## Step 1. You can find the Filter button in the Home Tab
