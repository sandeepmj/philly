# Sorting

**Sorting** sequences your data by a particular order, such as by date, name, category, or by number. 

**Filtering** narrows the data you can see to only the categories, dates, names, etc. that you choose.  (see the [filtering tutorial](https://github.com/sandeepmj/philly/blob/master/6-filtering.md))
